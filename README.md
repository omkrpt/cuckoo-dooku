# Cuckoo Dooku

A browser extension that helps you develop healthy habits which you often overlook while at work.

Count Dooku's spirit may be trapped in "an ordinary Star Wars themed cuckoo clock", but his word must not be taken for granted. Dooku has chosen you as his apprentice and will train you to take breaks, drink water, stretch out and take good care of yourself. Because after all, to truly master the Force you must be the best version of yourself!

> "Hmmm. Great care, we must take." (Yoda, Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith)


## Functionality

Cuckoo Dooku reminds you by sending browser notifications. Currently supported only by Google Chrome. Each Cuckoo is a configuration which creates a stream of alerts for the reminder you want, sent at regular intervals.

Clicking on any existing Cuckoo or on the Add New Cuckoo button takes you to the add/update menu. It supports the following functionality:
- Disable/snooze the Cuckoo
- Edit and customise the interval between reminders
- Specify the number of times you need to be alerted

On installation you get four pre-set disabled Cuckoos for posture correction, drinking water, resting your eyes and stretching your legs.
